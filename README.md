# blockchain

node1.py creates a node to run the blockchain

Currently getting 400 error when trying to create a new transaction (http://localhost:5000/transactions/new)

In progress:
  register a second node (see error above)
  verify consensus algorithm
  more difficult proof of work?
  
Completed:
  mine new coins
  check the chain of a coin
